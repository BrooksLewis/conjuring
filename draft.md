1. A walk at dawn.

    Coffee tastes better when Autumn rolls in with the fog. There's someone smoking pot (revolting). These are notes to keep me thinking. They've been written as if I wrote them then but they've been written now. Time is a funny thing. I did tai chi when I woke up. I only know the one routine but it helps wake my body up. I'm contemplating how particulate matter such as forestfiresmoke might mix with morningfog, and due to the rain I don't believe the forestfiresmoke will be a problem. There's hurricanes. There's a movie called The Day After Tomorrow. We're on fire. They're drowining. And lot of other shit in between. The world is a funny thing. I'm not so tired today. I took vitamin B. I should get in the habit. I dislike marijuana a great deal. The smell makes me gag. I imagine the smoke, invisible, to be a green colour. From outside I can see the people that live in the apartment beneath mine. They have a marijauna plant on their balcony. Obtuse. Someone's coughing wet. I don't want to live in a city any more. Give me deep woods or rushing brine. Give me the songs of birds in the morning but take back the traffic and the erratic gusts of smoke. We rely on plants to survive but plants get on well without us. Possibly I will become a flower. I'm going back to bed.

2. Words: flabbergast; vindictive; blasphemy. These were from a co-worker. I think he was having a bad day.

# *Notes*
Loosely braided essay format. Vegas, Art, and my walks through Penticton (ending with seagulls shitting on the bronze sculpture of children at Okanagan lake).

# *Composition*

October starts with the deadliest mass shooting in US history. I'm not a journalist. I'm not even a regular non-fiction writer. But, for what feels like the first time, I am affected deeply by current events. I am disturbed. What moves someone to act so selfishly? I feel as though I need to get more understanding of why people do this, so I'm going to write about my research into mass murders throughout history. Stephen Paddock, the Las Vegas shooter, had no immediately visible reason to fire a storm of bullets onto an unsuspecting country music festival. Until the investigation is complete, I can only guess at his motivation... Yet I find I am less interested in Paddock's reason for his crimes: Like many mass shooters before him, the police only got to Paddock after he killed himself, which seems to imply he was afraid. Of what, I cannot be sure. The consequences of his actions? If so, why was it so important to go through with this at all? Perhaps he felt regret, or maybe he felt suicide was justice, or a sadistic denial of justice (even his death is offensive).

I am bereft of emotion regarding the mass killings that have been etched into the canon of history. They are almost like fiction. But surely there are answers, lessons hidden in time: How are these types of murders possible? What are the catalysts? The warning signs? How can these murders be prevented, from a social point of view? I am of the opinon that civilians should not have access to military-grade weapons, such as assault rifles or machine guns, but these types of mass killings have surely occured before the advent of such weaponry, which suggests to me that the problem is not wholly political, but social as well.

Laszlo Toth attacked the Piet√† in 1972. He smashed off her arm at the elbow, broke her nose off, and chipped one of her eyes. He was never charged, because he appeared insane. He allegedly cried out "I am Jesus Christ, risen from the dead!" before vandalising the statue with a hammer. A direct comparison between Paddock and Toth only serves to lessen the magnitude of Paddock's crime-- instead, I am more interested in the motivation behind Toth's vandalism. Even if he truly was insane, I do not understand the selfishness behind Toth's actions. Accounts of Toth's brief trail describe how he charged the judge with the crime of 'pride', because they wanted to declare Christ [insane](https://books.google.ca/books?id=60ba0VmXVM8C&pg=PA202&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false). 

I see Toth as someone who raises himself above others. That he would proclaim himself to be Christ risen from the dead shows how he holds himself. Divine right or not, destroying a statue is a prideful act-- an irony that is central to my views about this seeming lack of empathy that Paddock and the countless other shooters demonstrate.

The vandalism of art is to me quite a horrendous thing.

I walk at a brisk pace down Penticton side streets on a joyless afternoon. It's been raining all week. I was born in this city, it should feel like home, but does not. I'm here for the week to visit my Grandma, but I've taken the day to myself.
