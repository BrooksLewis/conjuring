# Assignment Notes

1. A walk at dawn.

    Coffee tastes better when Autumn rolls in with the fog. There's someone smoking pot (revolting). These are notes to keep me thinking. They've been written as if I wrote them then but they've been written now. Time is a funny thing. I did tai chi when I woke up. I only know the one routine but it helps wake my body up. I'm contemplating how particulate matter such as forestfiresmoke might mix with morningfog, and due to the rain I don't believe the forestfiresmoke will be a problem. There's hurricanes. There's a movie called The Day After Tomorrow. We're on fire. They're drowining. And lot of other shit in between. The world is a funny thing. I'm not so tired today. I took vitamin B. I should get in the habit. I dislike marijuana a great deal. The smell makes me gag. I imagine the smoke, invisible, to be a green colour. From outside I can see the people that live in the apartment beneath mine. They have a marijauna plant on their balcony. Obtuse. Someone's coughing wet. I don't want to live in a city any more. Give me deep woods or rushing brine. Give me the songs of birds in the morning but take back the traffic and the erratic gusts of smoke. We rely on plants to survive but plants get on well without us. Possibly I will become a flower. I'm going back to bed.
