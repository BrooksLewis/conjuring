1. A walk at dawn.

    Coffee tastes better when Autumn rolls in with the fog. There's someone smoking pot (revolting). These are notes to keep me thinking. They've been written as if I wrote them then but they've been written now. Time is a funny thing. I did tai chi when I woke up. I only know the one routine but it helps wake my body up. I'm contemplating how particulate matter such as forestfiresmoke might mix with morningfog, and due to the rain I don't believe the forestfiresmoke will be a problem. There's hurricanes. There's a movie called The Day After Tomorrow. We're on fire. They're drowining. And lot of other shit in between. The world is a funny thing. I'm not so tired today. I took vitamin B. I should get in the habit. I dislike marijuana a great deal. The smell makes me gag. I imagine the smoke, invisible, to be a green colour. From outside I can see the people that live in the apartment beneath mine. They have a marijauna plant on their balcony. Obtuse. Someone's coughing wet. I don't want to live in a city any more. Give me deep woods or rushing brine. Give me the songs of birds in the morning but take back the traffic and the erratic gusts of smoke. We rely on plants to survive but plants get on well without us. Possibly I will become a flower. I'm going back to bed.

2. Words: flabbergast; vindictive; blasphemy. These were from a co-worker. I think he was having a bad day.

Cricket goes to town. Cricket buys some apples. Cricket goes to the pastures. Cricket feeds apple slices to the ostrich. Cricket returns home. Cricket goes to bed. Cricket dreams: of the prince leaving his father's palace to eat at Denny's because they'll give out a free breakfast on birthdays. Cricket wakes up: puts on her bra then takes it off and dresses without it. Cricket has coffee and asks big questions. Is Cricket really Cricket? How can Cricket tell? The ostrich could be the real Cricket, for all Cricket knows. But no, the ostrich's name is Geraldine.

Geraldine wakes up before dawn. Geraldine walks the perimeter of her fenced area. Geraldine anticipates the highlight of her day will be seeing Cricket. Geraldine itches her knees on her favorite metal gate-hinge. Geraldine fears Cricket will not appear before noon. Geraldine worries: Is Geraldine ever going to see Cricket again? How can Geraldine be sure that Cricket is okay? Geraldine is an ostrich of action. Today Geraldine must bring apples to Cricket.

I am the original, considers Cricket. She considers this, and does not know it, because the world does not make sense. I am the original. An affirmation. Hesitant. When Cricket puts her boots on to walk to town, her boots instead take her west, toward the ocean. It is not a very nice day today. Certianly not a day for the beach. Why are we going to the beach, asks Cricket of her boots. They are blue, worn rubber boots. They were her father's when he was younger, and when she puts them on she feels an echo in the gap left in the toes. We are going to splash around until you cheer up, said the boots to Cricket. And off they march.

At the beach, which is a good hour's trudge from Cricket's home near town, the boots stop at a smooth driftwood log not far from the water. The sand is white. Cricket sits and asks big questions. Is Cricket really Cricket? How can Cricket tell? These boots could be the real Cricket, for all Cricket knows. But no, the boots are just boots.


# *Sketch*

>~~Cricket steals a small seaplane and flies north from New Zealand to Japan, in protest of dormancy. She takes Geraldine, her friend who is an ostrich. Along the way, Cricket meets people who help her reshape her outlook on life. But not everything works out in her favour. At some point, she is forced to leave Geraldine behind, who is wise and accepts Cricket more than anyone. Eventually, Cricket, who is of course by now an internationally wanted person, is caught by the police and faces a jury.~~ Note: Writing out a neat plot synopsis feels the most unnatural thing in the world. I prefer to just stick my hands in and feel where the energy is. Outlining is fine, but future-telling can make things so drab. 

- While elements of surrealism may occasionally birth major plot points, everything outside of Cricket's perception/world is normal. She is not insane. Her unusual view of the world (and the tone of this fictional story) is derived from the arbitrary nature of the universe. Everything in our reality has a function (except, arguably, mosquitos).

- The repetitive sentence structure should probably be revised at some point. It is an experiment.
- Choose to draw on actual experience of flying small aircraft or craft Cricket's knowledge of it as if she flies by instinct. Like a bird. Perhaps she simply is a bird.
- Choose to extend surrealism to Geraldine's point of view, or have Geraldine be more sensible (leaning to the latter).

read the next day and am probably going to start afresh. I wasn't thinking clearly. I don't normally write like this (transparancy). It's difficult.

Update: None of that matters.

# *Toss the above, there are more important things happening.*

October starts with the deadliest mass shooting in US history. I'm not a journalist. I'm not even a regular non-fiction writer. But, for what feels like the first time, I am affected deeply by current events. I am disturbed. What moves someone to act so selfishly? I feel as though I need to get more understanding of why people do this, so I'm going to write about my research into mass murders throughout history. Stephen Paddock, the Las Vegas shooter, had no immediately visible reason to fire a storm of bullets onto an unsuspecting country music festival. Until the investigation is complete, I can only guess at his motivation... Yet I find I am less interested in Paddock's reason for his crimes: Like many mass shooters before him, the police only got to Paddock after he killed himself, which seems to imply he was afraid. Of what, I cannot be sure. The consequences of his actions? If so, why was it so important to go through with this at all? Perhaps he felt regret, or maybe he felt suicide was justice, or a sadistic denial of justice (even his death is offensive).

I am bereft of emotion regarding the mass killings that have been etched into the canon of history. They are almost like fiction. But surely there are answers, lessons hidden in time: How are these types of murders possible? What are the catalysts? The warning signs? How can these murders be prevented, from a social point of view? I am of the opinon that civilians should not have access to military-grade weapons, such as assault rifles or machine guns, but these types of mass killings have surely occured before the advent of such weaponry, which suggests to me that the problem is not wholly political, but social as well.

Laszlo Toth attacked the Piet√† in 1972. He smashed off her arm at the elbow, broke her nose off, and chipped one of her eyes. He was never charged, because he appeared insane. He allegedly cried out "I am Jesus Christ, risen from the dead!" before vandalising the statue with a hammer. A direct comparison between Paddock and Toth only serves to lessen the magnitude of Paddock's crime-- instead, I am more interested in the motivation behind Toth's vandalism. Even if he truly was insane, I do not understand the selfishness behind Toth's actions. Accounts of Toth's brief trail describe how he charged the judge with the crime of 'pride', because they wanted to declare Christ [insane](https://books.google.ca/books?id=60ba0VmXVM8C&pg=PA202&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false). 

I see Toth as someone who raises himself above others. That he would proclaim himself to be Christ risen from the dead shows how he holds himself. Divine right or not, destroying a statue is a prideful act-- an irony that is central to my views about this seeming lack of empathy that Paddock and the countless other shooters demonstrate.
