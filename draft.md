1. A walk at dawn.
Sunday, September 10th, 2017.
    
    Coffee tastes better when Autumn rolls in with the fog. There's someone smoking pot (revolting). These are notes to keep me thinking. They've been written as if I wrote them then but they've been written now. Time is a funny thing. I did tai chi when I woke up. I only know the one routine but it helps wake my body up. I'm contemplating how particulate matter such as forestfiresmoke might mix with morningfog, and due to the rain I don't believe the forestfiresmoke will be a problem. There's hurricanes. There's a movie called The Day After Tomorrow. We're on fire. They're drowining. And lot of other shit in between. The world is a funny thing. I'm not so tired today. I took vitamin B. I should get in the habit. I dislike marijuana a great deal. The smell makes me gag. I imagine the smoke, invisible, to be a green colour. From outside I can see the people that live in the apartment beneath mine. They have a marijauna plant on their balcony. Obtuse. Someone's coughing wet. I don't want to live in a city any more. Give me deep woods or rushing brine. Give me the songs of birds in the morning but take back the traffic and the erratic gusts of smoke. We rely on plants to survive but plants get on well without us. Possibly I will become a flower. I'm going back to bed.

2. Words: flabbergast; vindictive; blasphemy. These were from a co-worker. I think he was having a bad day.

# *Notes*
Loosely braided essay format. Vegas, Art, and my walks through Penticton (ending with seagulls shitting on the bronze sculpture of children at Okanagan lake).

Update: I'm opening things up. I'm writing about the idea of killing things rather than specifically the understanding of Stephen Paddock. I feel making my topic murkier will allow me to be more creative (I got tired of playing journalist).

# *Composition*

These are thoughts about killing.

I walk at a brisk pace down Penticton side streets on a joyless afternoon. It's been raining all week. I was born in this city, it should feel like home, but does not. I'm here for the week to visit my Grandma, but I've taken the day to myself.

Penticton; "a place to stay forever" in the Okanagan language. I love the city because of nostalgia, but I wouldn't want to stay forever. It's a popular retirement destination, probably not what the Interior Salish Okanagan people envisioned when they first settled between Skaha and Okanagan lake. The downtown area is modest, cute even: one way streets and sidewalk shops; an elderly couple holding hands steps into one of at least six thrift stores between two streets; a busker strums a guitar with a broken string at the entrance to the tunnel that connects Main street to a back alley, next to the second hand book store where I first met Kafka, Fitzgerald, and Italo Calvino. Their yellowing pages wrapped around me like blankets on winter nights.

On my walk, I wind north to Okanagan lake. The beach is usually empty on rainy days, and I always like to sit in the Penticton-Ikeda Japanese garden near the art gallery. But today I do not cross the bridge to enter the garden. Instead, I keep walking to look at the lake.

It's so big it looks like an ocean. The rain slows down, then stops. When I'm in this mood, I want rain. I want a great cathedral organ bellowing over the water and I want the waves to rise higher than my head. Instead I have a lack of wind, a caffeine headache, and wet socks. There's a bronze statue of three children playing right at the waterline on some rocks near a boardwalk. Bird shit, still glistening from rain, drips down from the faces of the children like tears. The birds have deliberate, precise aim.

October starts with the deadliest mass shooting in US history. I'm not a journalist. I'm not even a regular non-fiction writer. But, for what feels like the first time, I am affected deeply by current events. I am disturbed. What moves someone to act so selfishly? I feel as though I need to get more understanding of why people do this, so I'm going to write about my research into mass murders throughout history. Stephen Paddock, the Las Vegas shooter, had no immediately visible reason to fire a storm of bullets onto an unsuspecting country music festival. Until the investigation is complete, I can only guess at his motivation... Yet I find I am less interested in Paddock's reason for his crimes: Like many mass shooters before him, the police only got to Paddock after he killed himself, which seems to imply he was afraid. Of what, I cannot be sure. The consequences of his actions? If so, why was it so important to go through with this at all? Perhaps he felt regret, or maybe he felt suicide was justice, or a sadistic denial of justice (even his death is offensive).

I am bereft of emotion regarding the mass killings that have been etched into the canon of history. They are almost like fiction. But surely there are answers, lessons hidden in time: How are these types of murders possible? What are the catalysts? The warning signs? How can these murders be prevented, from a social point of view? I am of the opinion that civilians should not have access to military-grade weapons, such as assault rifles or machine guns, but these types of mass killings have surely occurred before the advent of such weaponry, which suggests to me that the problem is not wholly political, but social as well.

Tia and I squeeze past people in the MoMA. We've skirted the room and try to cut through the center to get to the next exhibit, but we're stopped by a stationary museum 'guard'. She doesn't seem like a normal attendant, based on the pepper spray on her utility belt.

"Watch yourself," she tells Tia. She places a hand on my girlfriend's arm.

"Excuse me?" I say.

"I mean look out," the guard explains. She gestures in front of her. A thin metal wire goes from the floor to the ceiling.

"Oh, sorry?" Tia says. "What is that? Seems kind of dangerous?"

The guard smirks, as if she's about to let us in on some big joke. "Art".

We find the escalators to the top floor and wait in line to line up to use them. The place is packed and we've just come from six hours at the Met. But we're in New York, so we have to see *Starry Night*. Once at the top, we jaunt through the surrounding rooms and quickly find a think knot of people around a wall in the center of an exhibit. Pushing through as much as is polite, I catch a glimpse of Van Gogh's iconic brushwork. It's *Starry Night* for real. Someone raises their camera and, no flash, steals a picture. There are people taking selfies with the painting, but it's mostly just them with a bunch of strangers because the painting is obscured from nearly every angle thanks to the crowding. A tall man about my age with a beard, circle glasses, and a cigarette tucked behind his ear puts away his camera and takes out his phone. He stands behind the crowd.

"This is modern art," he states. He takes his *Starry Night* picture, but does so through the twenty phone and camera screens positioned before him. On one hand I think that's a great idea for a photo, but on the other the guy just seems so arrogant that Tia and I walk away, leave the MoMa, get on the subway back to our rented apartment in Brooklyn, order some Indian comfort food, and talk about the annoyances of university culture and academic minded art-hipsters always trying to make a societal commentary out of everything.

Laszlo Toth attacked the Pietà in 1972. He smashed off her arm at the elbow, broke her nose off, and chipped one of her eyes. He was never charged, because he appeared insane. He allegedly cried out "I am Jesus Christ, risen from the dead!" before vandalising the statue with a hammer. Accounts of Toth's brief trail describe how he charged the judge with the crime of 'pride', because they wanted to declare Christ [insane](https://books.google.ca/books?id=60ba0VmXVM8C&pg=PA202&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false). 

I see Toth as someone who raises himself above others. That he would proclaim himself to be Christ risen from the dead shows how he holds himself. Divine right or not, destroying a statue is a prideful act-- an irony that is central to my views about this seeming lack of empathy that countless mass murderers demonstrate.

The vandalism of art is to me quite a horrendous thing.

I come back to the bronze children after buying a coffee and a bagel. The near by bench is wet but I sit on it anyways. As I settle in a seagull emerges from a cluster of large rocks and yips at me.

"Did you do this?" I ask him, gesturing to the stained children.

He walks and wobbles in a lateral way to avoid confronting me. Guilty. I rip off a piece of my bagel and toss it to him. I assume he's a *him*. Shitting on kids seems pretty masculine. Though, masculinity implies the concept of gender is useful to birds. Is it? I don't know.

I'm only here for five minutes of contemplating avian sexuality before another bird swoops down to stand before me. A crow. I've always liked crows. I toss him part of my bagel too, but the seagull freaks out and steals it. The crow flies off. I write some crap about The Majesty of Flying Rats but I rip it out of my notebook, as seen in movies. Having no where to toss it without staining my conscience, I smooth the page back into its place in the notebook to remove again later.

I've brought a book but don't feel like reading. I don't feel like doing anything, really. I just sit and imagine hours ooze by when really they remain before me. I imagine the children playing:

The three children run in a circle, chasing each other. They've been out all day, even though Tommy, on the left, lets his asthma show through his gaping laughter.

"My mom's making four-meat lasagna for dinner!" little Charlie tells his friends.

"My mom's making fried rice!" replies young Theo.

"I think it's make-your-own-dinner night tonight," adds Tommy, out of breath. "I'll probably have crackers and cheese. Hey, shouldn't we be getting back?"

"The sun's still up!"

"Yeah Tommy, the sun's up!"

"But it's going down, isn't it?" says Tommy.

"So?"

"Yeah, so?"

"My grandma told me if we stay out past dark the Ogopogo will come up and turn us into--"

"Your grandma's an alcoholic, Tommy!"

"Yeah Tommy, she's dumb!"

Tommy tries to ignore this wound but knows he'll regret not standing up to Charlie and Theo when the sun sets and the Ogopogo raises its long scaled snout from the lake and blesses the boys with its Jurassic breath, condemning them to bronze forever.

My brother accepts a vague asperger's diagnosis and told me once he could relate to psychopathic murderers. He has also told me he doesn't think he'll live past thirty. He's twenty-three. I am, as far as I know, his only friend.

I do not think he has considered the fact that these are alarming statements. Since then, he's not rescinded these comments but has told me that he thinks suicide is cowardly and "a real dick move to anyone left behind". This is the closest he's come to telling me he cares about me. 

He doesn't see the point in communicating his feelings very often. I understand this, I've grown up with him. He's four years younger than me and I've seen him go from a joyful, cherubic toddler to a brooding adult with poor hygiene and a resentment for The System. He's unemployed.

But behind his nearly unbreakable mask, he is gentle and caring. He is not a psychopath in the slightest. We were discussing one day, once I had come home from work, about the importances of empathy. He says:
    The death penalty is immoral, revenge is immoral, there's no point to it. If there is a guy, like a serial killer cannibal rapist kind of guy, and he's caught, and sentenced to death, then we're no better than him. He should have a choice, he could live the rest of his life away from society, like in prison or banished or something, or he could choose suicide. But taking away his right to choose, his human rights, that's basically what he did when he killed people. So we're no better. We think we are but we're not. We're all high horse people. Revenge is not justice. And even justice is questionable. It's too negative in our society. There's too much bias. If a serial-- an 'evil' guy-- if he decides to kill someone then-- Ugh, look. Anyone can do anything they want. Sometimes there's repercussions. But in nature, like animals and stuff, well. I don't know. Look. A guy kills someone and gets away with it. Eventually, most people move on. Isn't that enough? If he's caught, he should be removed, because he's dangerous, but he shouldn't be removed from LIFE. That's immoral. A pitchfork mob can't turn murder into justice. That's immoral.
   
There are some issues I take up with this opinion of his, but I find it fascinating that he is so concerned with the morality of justice. Sometimes he gets talking and just can't stop, the floodgates open and he gets excited. But he tries very hard to never say anything if he doesn't mean it. I believe that his thoughts on morality are rooted in a deep empathy.
